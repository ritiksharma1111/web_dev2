This web app is a simple task management tool built with Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, designed to help users add, manage, and track tasks with a customizable date and time for each entry. Everything runs in the browser‚Äîno backend or JSON files needed.

‚öôÔ∏è Technical Details:
HTML provides the page structure and input elements.

üß© Why Editable Date & Time Matters:
Adding an editable date and time makes this To-Do List more powerful than a basic checklist. Users can:

3.Plan ahead with time-sensitive tasks

4.It brings your app closer to real task planners like Google Tasks, but with lightweight, browser-only simplicity.
